.. title: [Q] How does it feel to not qualify in IIT JEE?
.. slug: q-how-does-it-feel-to-not-qualify-in-iit-jee

I failed IIT JEE. Got an abysmal score in BITSAT, AIEEE and Maharashtra CET. Its not that I had not tried hard, and I won't be playing the blame games on anyone but the truth is "**I had failed**".

I was very disappointed and so were my parents, and I felt somewhere I have let them down. My father had to use his contacts and (some extra money) to get me an admission at an engineering college, and I was low on confidence.

.. TEASER_END

I had to prove my myself, and gain back my family's confidence.

After my admission, I did only I thing, "**I enjoyed**", I kept my spirits high and started to learn to acquire knowledge and did not care about exam scores. I started learning to understand. I didn't study much, but I studied just enough to understand how exactly a particular thing works. I stopped focussing on the curriculum and more on expanding the breadth of my knowledge, and working on practical applications than rote learning.

**The outcomes**

1. I was in top 2 teams at inter-college level for Infosys CampusConnect Aspirations2020.
2. I got "decent" marks at first, and started being somewhat consistently in the top 5 students in my department.
3. I got through Google Summer of Code twice (2011 and 2012).
4. I was in the organizing committee for my college festival.
5. I got an awesome job just couple of days after my final exam.

**"People now know me not because of my ranks/scores, but because of my work and knowledge, and that is all that matters in the end, my knowledge. Period."**
