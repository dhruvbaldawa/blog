A few weeks back, I wrote `DropHere
<http://www.github.com/dhruvbaldawa/drophere>`_. Its written using `CoffeeScript
<http://coffeescript.org/>`_, `Node.js <http://nodejs.org/>`_ and `Express.js
<http://expressjs.com/>`_ and some HTML5 Drag and Drop APIs.

I created this project as a simple drag-and-drop file uploading service. It
uploads files to relevant file uploading service. For example, if you drop an
image file, it will be uploaded to `Imgur <http://www.imgur.com>`_ and similarly
text files will be uploaded to `Pastebin <http://www.pastebin.com>`_.

You can check out the live demo over `here <http://drophere.herokuapp.com>`_.

.. TEASER_END

The main reason behind this particular project was that often I need to share
code snippets and screenshots with colleagues, friends and then I have to take a
screenshot and then go upload to the relevant service or just mail it. Being the
kind of lazy I am, I thought of build this app and learning some new stuff on
the way :).

This was more of a learning project for me, trying to build complete javascript
applications for a Python developer like was a completely different experience,
a journey to explore CoffeeScript, Node.js and Test-driven development(TDD).

**How to use**

1. Go to http://drophere.herokuapp.com/.
2. Drag *any image or text* file from your computer.
3. Drop it into the browser.
4. Watch it upload and generate the link.

I would love to hear suggestions and feedback on this project.
